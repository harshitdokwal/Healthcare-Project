# Predictive Modeling in Healthcare: Multi-Class Classification of Medical Test Results using ML and DL Techniques
### The Healthcare Dataset is a synthetic dataset generated to mimic real-world healthcare data. It is designed to help data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts develop and test their skills in healthcare analytics while avoiding privacy concerns associated with real patient data. The dataset can be used for various tasks, such as classification, prediction, and data visualization, and focuses on solving a Multi-Class Classification Problem where the target is the Test Results column.

## Dataset Structure:

Here is a breakdown of the dataset's columns and their descriptions:

1. **Name**: This column contains the name of the patient associated with each healthcare record.
2. **Age**: Represents the age of the patient at the time of admission, in years.
3. **Gender**: Indicates the patient's gender, either "Male" or "Female."
4. **Blood Type**: The patient’s blood type, which could be one of the common types such as "A+", "O-", etc.
5. **Medical Condition**: Specifies the primary diagnosis or medical condition of the patient (e.g., "Diabetes," "Hypertension," "Asthma").
6. **Date of Admission**: The date on which the patient was admitted to the hospital or healthcare facility.
7. **Doctor**: The name of the doctor responsible for the patient’s care.
8. **Hospital**: Identifies the healthcare facility where the patient was admitted.
9. **Insurance Provider**: This column indicates the insurance provider (e.g., "Aetna," "Blue Cross," "Cigna").
10. **Billing Amount**: The cost of healthcare services billed to the patient, expressed as a floating-point number.
11. **Room Number**: The number of the room where the patient was accommodated during their stay.
12. **Admission Type**: Indicates the type of hospital admission (e.g., "Emergency," "Elective," or "Urgent").
13. **Discharge Date**: The date the patient was discharged from the facility, calculated based on the admission date.
14. **Medication**: Medication prescribed during the patient’s stay (e.g., "Aspirin," "Ibuprofen," "Penicillin").
15. **Test Results**: The results of a medical test performed during the patient’s stay. It is the **target column** for classification and has three possible outcomes: "Normal," "Abnormal," or "Inconclusive."
